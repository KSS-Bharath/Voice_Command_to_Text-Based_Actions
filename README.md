# Voice_Command_Project

This project converts spoken voice commands into text and maps them to specific system actions. It uses speech recognition to transcribe audio input and natural language processing (NLP) to interpret the intent behind the command. For example, saying "Open browser" or "Play music" would trigger corresponding actions on the device. The system aims to make human-computer interaction more intuitive and accessible, especially for hands-free or accessibility-focused applications.


## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Listens to your voice using a microphone.
- 📝 Converts spoken words into text.
- ⚙️ Can perform specific actions (e.g., opening apps, typing text).
- 🗣️ Provides voice feedback using TTS.
